//* I2C Peripheral Control LIA *//

// This code uses the I2C Protocol to link 2 arduinos.                                 //
// The Master Arduino aquires data from an RFID Reader/Writer.                          //
// It then ACCEPTS or REJECTS the RFID Sensor and displays it on an LCD.                //
// If it ACCEPTS, it comunicates through the I2C Protocol to a Peripheral Arduino.      //
// The Peripheral Arduino is in charge of a MicroServo, Ultrasonic sensor, and 4 Motors.//
// To be paired with i2c_Master_LIA.ino                                     //
